Anagram
=======

Finds all the anagram classes of a given dictionary. Sample dictionaries in the /src folder. Uses radix and counting sort algorithms for optimal perfomance.

If you run this with a large dictionary (100,000+) you may need to increase heap space. Running with agruments `-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m` should do the trick.

Probably from algorithms class
